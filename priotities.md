# Priotities

- ### Visualisierung
  - [ ] Terminal ASCII art
    - [ ] Address scaling visualization of memory layout
    - [ ] return addresses from methods
    - [ ] addresses from variables
    - [ ] differentiate Acceptable/Malicious changes in memory (color)
      - [ ] before after comparison
  - [ ] Terminal ncurses/pdcurses (optional)
    - [ ] Same as above
- ### User input
  - [ ] Buffer
    - [ ] File as input
      - [ ] get file path
      - [ ] read file input
      - [ ] error handling
        - [ ] file not found
        - [ ] no content in file
        - [ ] buffer size limit (maybe dynamically set)
    - [ ] buffer input via terminal
      - [ ] at the end of command
      - [ ] error handling like in file input
- ### Config
  - [ ] Configuration file
    - [ ] either default file
  - [ ] Terminal
    - [ ] file path for config
    - [ ] flags for command
  - options
    - show addresses for easier attacks
- ### Attacks
  - [ ] return address overwrite
  - [ ] loop skip
    - [ ] off by one
  - [ ] DEP
    - [ ] show effectiveness
    - [ ] show how to bypass
  - [ ] Format String Vulnerability
  - [ ] Integer Overflow Leading to Buffer Overflow
  - [ ] Bypassing ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) (just show addresses)
